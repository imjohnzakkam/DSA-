> The main thing about the problems in CP is  that problems are  framed  in such a way that the ones who have good knowledge of  the constraints, parameters, time complexity, effective use of data structures will be able to the problems. So, even though if you do know the algorithm, its hard. 

>  As we all know CP is basically math and combinations of the logic part. So, here there are some of the codes  for problems of math and logic part in two diffrent folders.
